When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is very convenient when you need to be able to access the repo from
several different locations. In addition, when you are working with other people on the
same repo, it is by definition a remote repo for all of them. Finally, it is impossible
to share a local repo with the public, which is what a remote repo (set to public) can
achieve.
