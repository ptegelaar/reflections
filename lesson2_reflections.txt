What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, a .git directory is created. This is
necessary in order to run git commands in that directory, s.a. git status, git
commit, etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory and the repository in
that it is an intermediate step. Here you can add files from the working
directory to the repository. It allows you to individually (or in bulk) files
to be committed to the repository. This means you can group files that
constitute a single logical change. Furthermore, you can double-check if what
is in the staging area is the actual stuff that you want to commit. If not, you
can remove files with "git reset".
